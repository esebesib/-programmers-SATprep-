Our project allows users an interactive experience to help them better study for the SAT, which is one of the hardest tests for high school students. The best way to study is to do many practice problems and that is where our project comes in. We collected many practice problems from different SAT prep guides and made a JSON file of both reading and math questions. Once the JSON file was made the code then would allow the user to be able to input the section that they wanted to work on, ‘math’ vs. ‘reading’. The user would then be prompted with a question and they would enter in the answer they think is correct. The code would then calculate how many they got right and the percentage of their score after each question so that the user knows how well they are doing while they are taking the test. If the percentage is really low they then will be given extra resources, such as links to SAT prep guides, to help them do better at the end when they finish. Lastly, if the user decides to stop studying they would enter in 'quit' which will stop the interactive program.
